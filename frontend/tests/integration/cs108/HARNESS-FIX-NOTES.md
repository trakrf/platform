# Test Harness Streaming Fix - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## Problem
The test harness was using `sendCommandAsync()` which waits for ONE response and blocks further notifications. This worked for command-response patterns (like barcode) but failed for streaming patterns (like RFID inventory).

## Root Cause
- `sendCommandAsync()` sets up a one-time notification handler that resolves on the first response
- After receiving the ACK for START_INVENTORY, it stops listening
- All subsequent 0x8100 inventory packets are dropped

## Solution
Changed the harness to work as a true bidirectional byte pipe:
1. Use `sendRawBytes()` (which calls `writeValue()`) for ALL outgoing commands - fire and forget
2. Handle ALL incoming data through the persistent notification handler
3. Both ACKs and autonomous notifications flow through the same path

## Code Changes

### rfid-reader-test-client.ts
Added new method for fire-and-forget sends:
```typescript
async sendRawBytes(command: Uint8Array): Promise<void> {
  await this.client.writeValue(command);
}
```

### CS108WorkerTestHarness.ts
Changed `setupTransportCapture()` to use fire-and-forget:
```typescript
// OLD: Blocked on one response
this.rfidClient.sendRawCommand(message.data).then(response => {
  // Only got ONE response, missed streaming packets
});

// NEW: Fire and forget, all responses come through notifications
this.rfidClient.sendRawBytes(message.data).catch(error => {
  // Just log errors, don't block
});
```

## Test Results
With this fix, the inventory test now properly receives streaming packets:
- Test tags defined in test-utils/constants.ts are properly detected
- Multiple tag packets flow through the streaming notification channel
- Both command ACKs and autonomous tag reads are received

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL Architecture Principle: BIDIRECTIONAL BYTE PIPE

**EVERYTHING is a bidirectional byte pipe. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

The entire transport stack is just dumb pipes streaming bytes:
1. **Hardware â†” Bridge Server**: Just bytes over BLE
2. **Bridge Server â†” NodeBleClient**: Just bytes over WebSocket
3. **NodeBleClient â†” Test Harness**: Just bytes through notifications
4. **Test Harness â†” Worker**: Just bytes through MessagePort

**Key Insights**:
- **NO request-response patterns** in the transport layer
- **ALL data flows through notifications** - both command ACKs and autonomous packets
- **Commands are fire-and-forget** - send bytes and move on
- **Responses come asynchronously** through the notification stream
- **The worker's protocol layer** is the ONLY place with intelligence

This architecture ensures:
- Test behavior EXACTLY matches production behavior
- No test-specific conveniences that mask real issues
- Streaming patterns (like inventory) work identically to single responses
- The transport can't "eat" responses by waiting for just one

**The Golden Rule**: If you're thinking about request-response patterns in the transport, you're doing it wrong. It's ALL just a bidirectional stream of bytes.
