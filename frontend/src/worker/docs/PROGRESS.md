# CS108 Implementation Progress

## Current Status: Phase 3 - Command Implementation

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- ‚úÖ Test framework with transport verification
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for constants
- ‚úÖ Clean workspace (old code moved to `-old` dirs)
- ‚úÖ Basic CS108Reader skeleton

#### Phase 2: Architecture & State Management
- ‚úÖ BaseReader/CS108Reader inheritance model
- ‚úÖ MessagePort transport layer setup
- ‚úÖ State machine (DISCONNECTED ‚Üí CONNECTING ‚Üí READY)
- ‚úÖ Mode management (null ‚Üí IDLE on connect)
- ‚úÖ Domain event emission
- ‚úÖ Test harness with real hardware bridge
- ‚úÖ All TypeScript/lint issues resolved

### üöß In Progress

#### Phase 3: Command Implementation
- ‚úÖ Packet type system (CS108Packet)
- ‚úÖ Packet builder with CS108 constants
- ‚úÖ Packet parser with auto-parsing
- ‚è≥ Command sending via MessagePort
- ‚è≥ Response parsing and routing
- ‚è≥ Error handling for timeouts/NAKs
- ‚è≥ First real command (GET_VERSION or RFID_POWER_OFF)

### üìã Upcoming Phases

#### Phase 4: Mode Sequences
- ‚è≥ IDLE mode command sequences
- ‚è≥ INVENTORY mode transitions
- ‚è≥ BARCODE mode (if module available)
- ‚è≥ Mode-specific settings application

#### Phase 5: Operations
- ‚è≥ Start/stop scanning with proper sequencing
- ‚è≥ Inventory stop with delayed effect handling
- ‚è≥ Settings persistence and validation
- ‚è≥ Complete domain event coverage

#### Phase 6: Migration & Cleanup
- ‚è≥ DeviceManager integration
- ‚è≥ Store event routing
- ‚è≥ Remove old implementation
- ‚è≥ Update UI components

## Metrics

### Code Reduction
- **Original**: ~10,000 LOC (spaghetti)
- **Current**: ~1,500 LOC (clean)
- **Target**: 2,000-3,000 LOC (complete)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 0% (focusing on integration)
- **Integration Tests**: 40% (core flows)
- **Target**: 90% coverage

### Technical Debt
- **Removed**: Complex store coupling, hardcoded bytes
- **Added**: None (clean architecture)
- **Remaining**: Old code cleanup

## Recent Changes

### January 2025
- Split massive specification into focused docs
- Implemented CS108Packet type system
- Fixed build issues with import paths
- Created vite-mock.config.ts to resolve circular dependencies

### December 2024
- Established TDD test harness
- Implemented BaseReader pattern
- Set up MessagePort transport
- Created domain event system

## Known Issues

### High Priority
- [ ] Inventory stop command has 2-5 second delay
- [ ] Fragment reassembly needs A7B3 reset logic
- [ ] Command queue not yet implemented

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Battery percentage calculation needs calibration
- [ ] RSSI values need normalization
- [ ] Mode transition timing needs optimization

### Low Priority
- [ ] Locate mode not implemented
- [ ] Barcode module detection
- [ ] Advanced inventory settings

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 3**
   - Implement sendCommand with timeout
   - Add response routing logic
   - Test with real RFID_POWER_ON command

2. **Start Phase 4**
   - Map out IDLE mode sequences
   - Implement INVENTORY configuration
   - Test mode transitions

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Add inventory operation tests
   - Test error recovery scenarios
   - Verify domain events

## Success Criteria

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] Can send any CS108 command
- [ ] Responses are parsed correctly
- [ ] Timeouts trigger errors
- [ ] NAK responses handled

### Phase 4 Complete When:
- [ ] All modes configurable
- [ ] Transitions go through IDLE
- [ ] Settings applied correctly
- [ ] Mode-specific operations work

### Phase 5 Complete When:
- [ ] Inventory reads tags
- [ ] Stop command works reliably
- [ ] All events emitted
- [ ] Settings persistent

## Team Notes

### What's Working Well
- TDD approach catching issues early
- Real hardware testing invaluable
- Clean architecture paying off
- Type system preventing bugs

### Challenges
- Hardware quirks (inventory stop delay)
- Fragmentation complexity
- Command timing sensitivity
- Bridge server stability

### Lessons Learned
- Don't mock hardware behavior
- Test with real devices ASAP
- Keep constants centralized
- Document quirks immediately
