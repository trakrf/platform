# Document Moved

The CS108 Refactor Specification has been reorganized for better readability.

## New Structure

- **[README.md](./README.md)** - Quick start and overview
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design and data flow
- **[IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Code patterns and examples
- **[TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)** - Test strategies and harness usage
- **[PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md)** - Current status and roadmap

## Original Document

The original 1600+ line specification has been archived at:
[archive/CS108-REFACTOR-SPECIFICATION.md](./archive/CS108-REFACTOR-SPECIFICATION.md)

The new structure provides the same information in a more digestible format with better organization and less redundancy.
