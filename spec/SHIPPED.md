## Phase 3: Database Migrations
- **Date**: 2025-10-17
- **Branch**: feature/active-phase-3-database-migrations
- **Commit**: 7455398
- **PR**: https://github.com/trakrf/platform/pull/9
- **Summary**: Replace Docker entrypoint SQL with golang-migrate versioned migrations
- **Key Changes**:
  - Installed golang-migrate v4.17.0 CLI in backend Docker image
  - Created 24 migration files (12 up/down pairs) from database/init/
  - Added 5 Just commands for migration workflow (up, down, status, create, force)
  - Removed docker-entrypoint-initdb.d volume mount, added migrations volume
  - Auto-migration on `just dev` startup
  - Added .env.example for developer onboarding
  - Updated README.md and backend/README.md with migration documentation
- **Validation**: ✅ All checks passed

### Success Metrics
(From spec.md - all metrics achieved)
- ✅ All 12 migrations created from existing SQL files - **Result**: 24 files created (12 up/down pairs), verbatim SQL copy
- ✅ `just db-migrate-up` produces identical schema to current `database/init/` approach - **Result**: Schema verified identical, zero drift
- ✅ Down migrations successfully drop all tables/functions/sequences - **Result**: CASCADE drops tested, all objects cleaned up
- ✅ Migration version tracked in `schema_migrations` table - **Result**: Version 12 confirmed operational
- ✅ Documentation complete with migration workflow examples - **Result**: README.md + backend/README.md updated with commands and workflows
- ✅ Zero schema drift between old and new approach - **Result**: Pure infrastructure change, no schema modifications

**Overall Success**: 100% of metrics achieved

### Technical Highlights
- Migration timing: ~400-600ms per migration (TimescaleDB hypertables take longer)
- Full lifecycle tested: fresh → up → down → cascade → re-up
- Sample data down migration is no-op (cleanup via table CASCADE drops)
- sh -c wrapper in justfile for proper environment variable expansion
- Migrations mounted as Docker volume for development workflow
