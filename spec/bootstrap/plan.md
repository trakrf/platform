# Implementation Plan: CSW Bootstrap Validation
Generated: 2025-10-16
Specification: spec.md

## Understanding

This is a meta-feature that validates the Claude Spec Workflow (CSW) installation by verifying the spec/ directory structure, checking that required files exist, and confirming that validation commands are properly configured. This serves as:
1. A validation checkpoint that CSW is correctly installed
2. A hands-on test of the CSW workflow itself
3. Documentation of what was installed and when

The implementation is validation-only (no code changes), with results reported to console.

## Relevant Files

**Files to Verify** (no modifications):
- `spec/README.md` - Workflow documentation (already exists)
- `spec/template.md` - Template for new specs (already exists)
- `spec/stack.md` - Validation commands for TypeScript + React + Vite (already exists)
- `spec/SHIPPED.md` - Completed features log (already exists)

**Files to Remove**:
- `spec/active/csw-bootstrap/` - Duplicate directory from previous attempt

**Directory Structure to Validate**:
```
spec/
├── README.md
├── template.md
├── stack.md
├── SHIPPED.md
├── active/
├── bootstrap/
│   ├── spec.md
│   └── plan.md (this file)
└── csw (symlink)
```

## Architecture Impact

- **Subsystems affected**: Infrastructure/validation only
- **New dependencies**: None
- **Breaking changes**: None (cleanup only removes duplicate directory)

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Clean up duplicate directory
**Action**: REMOVE
**Path**: `spec/active/csw-bootstrap/`

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Remove the duplicate directory from previous bootstrap attempt
rm -rf spec/active/csw-bootstrap/
```

**Validation**:
```bash
# Verify directory is removed
test ! -d spec/active/csw-bootstrap/ && echo "✓ Cleanup complete"
```

---

### Task 2: Verify spec/README.md
**Action**: VERIFY
**Path**: `spec/README.md`

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Check file exists and contains key sections
test -f spec/README.md || exit 1
grep -q "Specification-Driven Development System" spec/README.md || exit 1
grep -q "Workflow Overview" spec/README.md || exit 1
```

**Validation**:
Report: "✓ spec/README.md exists and contains workflow documentation"

---

### Task 3: Verify spec/template.md
**Action**: VERIFY
**Path**: `spec/template.md`

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Check file exists and has required template sections
test -f spec/template.md || exit 1
grep -q "## Metadata" spec/template.md || exit 1
grep -q "## Outcome" spec/template.md || exit 1
grep -q "## User Story" spec/template.md || exit 1
```

**Validation**:
Report: "✓ spec/template.md exists and is ready for copying"

---

### Task 4: Verify spec/stack.md validation commands
**Action**: VERIFY
**Path**: `spec/stack.md`

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Check file exists and contains all required validation command sections
test -f spec/stack.md || exit 1
grep -q "## Lint" spec/stack.md || exit 1
grep -q "## Typecheck" spec/stack.md || exit 1
grep -q "## Test" spec/stack.md || exit 1
grep -q "## Build" spec/stack.md || exit 1
grep -q "TypeScript + React + Vite" spec/stack.md || exit 1
```

**Validation**:
Report: "✓ spec/stack.md contains validation commands for TypeScript + React + Vite"

---

### Task 5: Verify spec/SHIPPED.md
**Action**: VERIFY
**Path**: `spec/SHIPPED.md`

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Check file exists (content will be added when this feature ships)
test -f spec/SHIPPED.md || exit 1
```

**Validation**:
Report: "✓ spec/SHIPPED.md exists and ready for feature tracking"

---

### Task 6: Verify directory structure
**Action**: VERIFY
**Paths**: `spec/active/`, `spec/bootstrap/`

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Check required directories exist
test -d spec/active/ || exit 1
test -d spec/bootstrap/ || exit 1
test -f spec/bootstrap/spec.md || exit 1
test -f spec/bootstrap/plan.md || exit 1
```

**Validation**:
Report: "✓ Directory structure matches documentation"

---

### Task 7: Generate validation report
**Action**: REPORT

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Print comprehensive validation report to console
cat <<EOF

========================================
CSW Bootstrap Validation Report
========================================
Installation Date: 2025-10-16
Stack: TypeScript + React + Vite
Preset: typescript-react-vite

✓ spec/README.md - Workflow documentation present
✓ spec/template.md - Template ready for copying
✓ spec/stack.md - Validation commands configured
✓ spec/SHIPPED.md - Feature tracking ready
✓ Directory structure matches documentation
✓ Cleanup completed (removed duplicate csw-bootstrap)

ALL VALIDATION CHECKS PASSED

Next Steps:
1. Run: /check (validate PR readiness)
2. Run: /ship (complete and archive this spec)
3. This will create first entry in SHIPPED.md

========================================
EOF
```

**Validation**:
User sees comprehensive report with all checks passing.

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Old `spec/active/csw-bootstrap/` directory contains important work
  **Mitigation**: Confirmed with user that this is a duplicate to be removed

- **Risk**: Validation commands in stack.md don't match project setup
  **Mitigation**: Only checking that commands are defined, not executing them (per user preference)

- **Risk**: Missing required files
  **Mitigation**: All files already confirmed present via preliminary checks

## Integration Points

None - This is a standalone validation feature with no code integration.

## VALIDATION GATES (MANDATORY)

This feature is validation-only (no code changes), so traditional lint/typecheck/test gates don't apply.

**Instead, validation is the feature itself:**
- Each task has explicit verification steps
- Final report confirms all checks passed
- If any verification fails, the task fails

**Success criteria**: All 7 tasks report success in final validation report.

## Validation Sequence

After each task: Verify the specific check passes (see task-level validation)

Final validation: Generate comprehensive report showing all checks passed

## Plan Quality Assessment

**Complexity Score**: 1/10 (LOW)
**Confidence Score**: 10/10 (HIGH)

**Confidence Factors**:
✅ Clear requirements from spec (simple file existence checks)
✅ All files already confirmed to exist via preliminary research
✅ All clarifying questions answered with simple approach
✅ No external dependencies or new patterns needed
✅ Straightforward bash validation logic

**Assessment**: This is a straightforward validation feature with minimal complexity and high confidence. All required files already exist, and the task is simply verifying their presence and content structure.

**Estimated one-pass success probability**: 95%

**Reasoning**: The only potential issue is if file paths or grep patterns are slightly off, but since files were already verified during research phase, success is highly likely. The 5% uncertainty accounts for minor syntax issues in bash validation commands.
