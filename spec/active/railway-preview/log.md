# Build Log: Railway Preview Environment

## Session: 2025-01-26T15:30:00Z
Starting task: 1
Total tasks: 8

## Overview
This build implements an automated preview environment that:
- Merges all open PRs into a `preview` branch via GitHub Actions
- Auto-deploys to Railway at `https://app.preview.trakrf.id`
- Runs database migrations automatically on every deploy
- Posts deployment status to PR comments

**Infrastructure-only changes** - No backend/frontend code modifications required.

## Implementation Strategy
Following the 8-task plan from plan.md with validation gates after infrastructure file creation.

---

### Task 1: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Started: 2025-01-26T15:35:00Z
File: .github/workflows/sync-preview.yml

**Implementation**:
- Created `.github/workflows/` directory
- Copied reference workflow from `../trakrf-handheld/.github/workflows/sync-preview.yml`
- Updated line 165 to include preview URL: `https://app.preview.trakrf.id`
- All other workflow logic unchanged (project-agnostic)

**Validation**:
✅ File created at `.github/workflows/sync-preview.yml`
✅ URL updated to `app.preview.trakrf.id`

Status: ✅ Complete
Completed: 2025-01-26T15:36:00Z

---

### Task 2: Create Root Dockerfile
Started: 2025-01-26T15:37:00Z
File: Dockerfile (repository root)

**Implementation**:
- 4-stage build: frontend-builder → backend-builder → production
- Stage 1: Node 20 Alpine + pnpm + frontend build
- Stage 2: Go 1.23 Alpine + migrate CLI + backend build
  - Uses layer caching for go.mod/go.sum (pattern from backend/Dockerfile:28-30)
  - Installs migrate CLI (pattern from backend/Dockerfile:9-12)
  - Copies frontend dist to `backend/frontend/dist` for go:embed
- Stage 3: Alpine 3.20 production
  - Copies migrate CLI, server binary, migrations, entrypoint script
  - Sets executable permissions on entrypoint

**Critical Paths**:
- Frontend dist: `/app/frontend/dist` → `backend/frontend/dist` → embedded in server
- Migrations: `database/migrations/` → `/app/database/migrations`
- Entrypoint: `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` → `/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh`

**Validation**:
✅ File created at `Dockerfile` (repository root)
✅ Go module files verified (go.mod, go.sum)
✅ Follows established patterns from backend/Dockerfile

Status: ✅ Complete
Completed: 2025-01-26T15:38:00Z

---

### Task 3: Create Migration Entrypoint Script
Started: 2025-01-26T15:39:00Z
File: scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh

**Implementation**:
- Created `scripts/` directory
- Shell script with error handling (`set -e`)
- Runs migrations: `migrate -path /app/database/migrations -database "$PG_URL" up`
- Uses `exec "$@"` for proper signal handling (replaces shell with server process)
- Migration path matches Dockerfile COPY destination

**Validation**:
✅ File created at `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh`
✅ Bash syntax validated with `bash -n`
✅ Migration path matches Dockerfile: `/app/database/migrations`

Status: ✅ Complete
Completed: 2025-01-26T15:40:00Z

---

### Task 4: Create Railway Configuration
Started: 2025-01-26T15:41:00Z
File: railway.json (repository root)

**Implementation**:
- Explicit Dockerfile builder configuration
- Start command: `/server`
- Healthcheck: `/healthz` with 100s timeout
- Restart policy: ON_FAILURE with 3 max retries

**Rationale**:
- Railway auto-detects, but explicit config documents intent
- Serves as reference for future GKE migration
- Healthcheck prevents unhealthy deploys

**Validation**:
✅ File created at `railway.json`
✅ JSON syntax validated with `jq`

Status: ✅ Complete
Completed: 2025-01-26T15:42:00Z

---

### Task 5: Local Docker Build & Test Validation
Started: 2025-01-26T15:43:00Z

**Issues Encountered & Resolved**:
1. **Go version mismatch**: Dockerfile used Go 1.23, but go.mod requires 1.25.1
   - Fix: Updated Dockerfile to `golang:1.25-alpine`
2. **pnpm workspace configuration**: Frontend build failed due to missing workspace context
   - Fix: Copied `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `.npmrc`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml` to Docker workspace root
   - Used `pnpm --filter frontend run build` for workspace-aware builds

**Docker Build**:
✅ All 4 stages completed successfully
- Frontend builder: Node 20 + pnpm + Vite build (759KB main chunk)
- Backend builder: Go 1.25 + server binary (version 0.1.0-preview)
- Production: Alpine 3.20 with all artifacts

**Runtime Testing**:
- Container started with preview DB credentials
- Migrations ran successfully (6 migrations applied)
- Server started on port 8080

**Healthcheck Validation**:
✅ `GET /healthz` → 200 OK (liveness)
✅ `GET /readyz` → 200 OK (DB connected)
✅ `GET /health` → JSON response with status, version, uptime, database connected
✅ `GET /` → 200 OK (frontend accessible)

**Critical Paths Verified**:
✅ Frontend dist embedded correctly (go:embed working)
✅ Migrations path correct (/app/database/migrations)
✅ Entrypoint script working (migrations → server)
✅ Database connection successful (TimescaleDB Cloud preview)

Status: ✅ Complete
Completed: 2025-01-26T15:50:00Z

### Task 6: Railway Project Setup (MANUAL CONFIGURATION REQUIRED)
Started: 2025-01-26T15:51:00Z

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This task requires manual configuration via Railway dashboard.**

The following steps must be performed manually to complete the Railway deployment:

#### Step 1: Create New Railway Project

1. Log in to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/
2. Click "New Project"
3. Project name: **TrakRF Platform Preview**
4. Region: Select **us-west** (or closest to your location)

#### Step 2: Connect GitHub Repository

1. In the new project, click "New Service"
2. Select "GitHub Repo"
3. Choose repository: **trakrf/platform**
4. Deploy branch: **preview** (will be created by GitHub Actions workflow)
5. Root directory: **/** (monorepo root)
6. Enable "Auto-deploy": **Yes** (deploy on push to preview branch)

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables in Railway dashboard (Settings → Variables):

```bash
# Database Connection (TimescaleDB Cloud)
PG_URL=postgres://tsdbadmin:<PASSWORD>@hxumbw51zr.lezu4cbb98.tsdb.cloud.timescale.com:34826/tsdb?sslmode=require

# Backend Configuration
BACKEND_PORT=8080
BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL=debug
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGIN=disabled

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=<GENERATE_RANDOM_32_CHARS>

# Railway Standard Port (optional, defaults to BACKEND_PORT)
PORT=8080
```

**To generate JWT_SECRET:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

**To get PG_URL password:**
```bash
grep PG_URL_PREVIEW .env.local | cut -d= -f2 | sed 's/"//g'
```

**Credential Reference:**
- **Host**: hxumbw51zr.lezu4cbb98.tsdb.cloud.timescale.com
- **Port**: 34826
- **Database**: tsdb
- **Username**: tsdbadmin
- **Password**: See `.env.local` (PG_URL_PREVIEW)

#### Step 4: Verify Railway Configuration

In Railway dashboard, verify the following settings:

**Build Settings:**
- ✅ Builder: Dockerfile (auto-detected from railway.json)
- ✅ Dockerfile path: Dockerfile (repository root)
- ✅ Build context: Repository root

**Deploy Settings:**
- ✅ Start command: /server (from railway.json)
- ✅ Healthcheck path: /healthz (from railway.json)
- ✅ Healthcheck timeout: 100s (from railway.json)
- ✅ Restart policy: ON_FAILURE with 3 retries (from railway.json)

#### Step 5: Note Railway CNAME for DNS Configuration

After the project is created, Railway will generate a deployment URL:

1. Go to project Settings → Domains
2. Note the Railway-provided domain (format: `{service-name}-production-{random}.up.railway.app`)
3. **Save this CNAME value** - it will be needed for DNS configuration in Task 7

**Example CNAME:**
```
trakrf-preview-production-a1b2c3d4.up.railway.app
```

#### Step 6: Trigger Initial Deployment (Optional)

The `preview` branch doesn't exist yet (will be created by GitHub Actions), but you can:

1. Wait for first PR to trigger workflow
2. OR manually create preview branch to test:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b preview origin/main
   git push -u origin preview
   ```

**Expected first deploy:**
- Railway will detect preview branch push
- Build will start automatically (using root Dockerfile)
- Frontend build: ~2-3 minutes
- Backend build: ~1-2 minutes
- Total deploy time: ~5-7 minutes (first build)
- Subsequent deploys: ~2-3 minutes (with layer caching)

#### Step 7: Verify Deployment Success

Once Railway deployment completes:

1. Check deployment logs for:
   - ✅ Frontend build success (Vite)
   - ✅ Backend build success (Go)
   - ✅ Migrations ran successfully
   - ✅ Server started
   - ✅ Healthcheck passed

2. Test Railway URL directly (before DNS):
   ```bash
   curl https://{your-railway-url}/healthz
   # Expected: 200 OK
   ```

**Status**: ⏸️ Awaiting Manual Completion
**Next Step**: Complete Railway setup, then proceed to Task 7 (DNS Configuration)

---

### Task 7: DNS Configuration (MANUAL TERRAFORM UPDATE REQUIRED)
Started: 2025-01-26T15:52:00Z

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This task requires manual Terraform update in trakrf/infra repository.**

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you must have:
1. ✅ Railway project created and deployed (Task 6 complete)
2. ✅ Railway CNAME URL noted (from Task 6, Step 5)
3. ✅ Access to `github.com/trakrf/infra` repository
4. ✅ Terraform CLI installed and configured

#### Step 1: Get Railway CNAME

From Railway dashboard (Task 6, Step 5), you should have noted the CNAME:

**Format:**
```
{service-name}-production-{random}.up.railway.app
```

**Example:**
```
trakrf-preview-production-a1b2c3d4.up.railway.app
```

#### Step 2: Update Terraform Configuration

Navigate to the `trakrf/infra` repository and add the DNS record:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/trakrf/infra
```

**Edit the Cloudflare DNS configuration file** (exact location depends on your Terraform structure):

```hcl
# Add to DNS configuration (likely in modules/dns/cloudflare.tf or similar)

resource "cloudflare_record" "app_preview" {
  zone_id = var.trakrf_zone_id
  name    = "app.preview"
  type    = "CNAME"
  value   = "{railway-cname-from-step-1}"  # Replace with actual CNAME
  proxied = false  # Direct to Railway for SSL
  ttl     = 1      # Auto TTL
  comment = "Platform preview environment (Railway)"
}
```

**Important configuration notes:**
- **proxied = false**: Must be false to allow Railway to manage SSL certificate
- **ttl = 1**: Automatic TTL (Cloudflare managed)
- **name = "app.preview"**: Creates `app.preview.trakrf.id` subdomain

#### Step 3: Validate Terraform Changes

```bash
# Initialize Terraform (if needed)
terraform init

# Validate syntax
terraform validate

# Preview changes (dry run)
terraform plan
```

**Expected output:**
```
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy

  + cloudflare_record.app_preview
      name    = "app.preview"
      type    = "CNAME"
      value   = "{your-railway-cname}"
      proxied = false
```

#### Step 4: Apply Terraform Changes

```bash
# Apply the DNS configuration
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the changes.

**Expected result:**
```
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

#### Step 5: Verify DNS Propagation

Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS propagation, then verify:

```bash
# Check CNAME record
dig app.preview.trakrf.id CNAME

# Expected output:
# app.preview.trakrf.id. 300 IN CNAME {railway-cname}.

# Verify HTTPS works (Railway auto-provisions SSL)
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/healthz

# Expected: 200 OK
```

#### Step 6: Test Full Stack Access

```bash
# Healthcheck
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/healthz
# Expected: ok

# Readiness check
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/readyz
# Expected: ok

# Full health status
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/health
# Expected: JSON with status, version, database connected

# Frontend
curl -I https://app.preview.trakrf.id/
# Expected: 200 OK with text/html content-type

# API endpoint
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/api/v1/accounts
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (auth required - correct behavior)
```

#### Troubleshooting

**If DNS doesn't resolve:**
- Wait longer (up to 10 minutes for full propagation)
- Check Terraform apply succeeded
- Verify CNAME value matches Railway domain exactly
- Use `dig @8.8.8.8 app.preview.trakrf.id` to query Google DNS directly

**If HTTPS fails:**
- Railway needs time to provision SSL certificate (5-10 minutes after DNS)
- Check Railway deployment logs for certificate errors
- Verify `proxied = false` in Terraform (must not proxy through Cloudflare)

**If healthcheck fails:**
- Check Railway deployment status (must be successful)
- Verify environment variables configured correctly (Task 6, Step 3)
- Check Railway logs for database connection errors

**Status**: ⏸️ Awaiting Manual Completion
**Next Step**: Complete DNS configuration, then proceed to Task 8 (E2E Workflow Test)

### Task 8: End-to-End Workflow Test (VALIDATION)
Started: 2025-01-26T15:53:00Z

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This task validates the complete preview deployment workflow.**

This test verifies that:
1. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow merges PRs into preview branch
2. ✅ Railway auto-deploys when preview branch updates
3. ✅ Migrations run automatically on deploy
4. ✅ Preview environment is accessible at `app.preview.trakrf.id`
5. ✅ PR comments notify developers of deployment status

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you must have:
1. ✅ Railway project configured and deployed (Task 6)
2. ✅ DNS configured and propagated (Task 7)
3. ✅ Preview URL accessible: `https://app.preview.trakrf.id`

#### Step 1: Create Test PR

Create a test branch and PR to trigger the workflow:

```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout -b test/preview-workflow

# Add test file
echo "# Preview Test" > PREVIEW_TEST.md
git add PREVIEW_TEST.md

# Commit changes
git commit -m "test: verify preview deployment workflow"

# Push branch
git push -u origin test/preview-workflow

# Create PR
gh pr create \
  --title "Test: Preview Workflow" \
  --body "Testing preview deployment automation for TRA-81"
```

#### Step 2: Verify GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Monitor workflow execution**:
   - Go to: `https://github.com/trakrf/platform/actions`
   - Find "Sync Preview Branch" workflow run
   - Should trigger automatically when PR is opened

2. **Check workflow logs**:
   ```
   ✅ Checkout repository
   ✅ Configure Git
   ✅ Reset preview to main
   ✅ Get all open PRs (should find test PR)
   ✅ Merge PRs into preview (test PR merged)
   ✅ Push preview branch
   ✅ Post deployment status comment
   ```

3. **Expected timeline**:
   - Workflow triggers: <30 seconds after PR opened
   - Workflow completes: ~1-2 minutes
   - Total time: ~2 minutes

#### Step 3: Verify PR Comment Posted

Check the test PR for automated comment from `github-actions[bot]`:

**Expected comment format:**
```markdown
🚀 Preview Deployment Update

✅ This PR has been successfully merged into the preview branch.

The preview environment will update shortly at: **https://app.preview.trakrf.id**
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Comment posted within 1 minute of workflow completion
- ✅ Preview URL included in comment
- ✅ Comment posted by github-actions[bot]

#### Step 4: Verify Railway Deployment

1. **Monitor Railway deployment**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Select "TrakRF Platform Preview" project
   - Check "Deployments" tab

2. **Expected deployment logs**:
   ```
   ✅ Build started (triggered by preview branch push)
   ✅ Frontend build (pnpm + Vite)
   ✅ Backend build (Go 1.25)
   ✅ Migrations run (6 migrations applied)
   ✅ Server started
   ✅ Healthcheck passed
   ```

3. **Expected timeline**:
   - Build trigger: <30 seconds after preview branch push
   - Build time: ~5-7 minutes (first deploy) or ~2-3 minutes (cached)
   - Total time from PR to deploy: ~7-9 minutes

#### Step 5: Verify Preview Environment

Test the deployed preview environment:

```bash
# Healthcheck (liveness)
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/healthz
# Expected: ok

# Readiness check (DB connected)
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/readyz
# Expected: ok

# Full health status
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/health | jq .
# Expected JSON:
# {
#   "status": "ok",
#   "version": "0.1.0-preview",
#   "timestamp": "...",
#   "uptime": "...",
#   "database": "connected"
# }

# Frontend accessibility
curl -I https://app.preview.trakrf.id/
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 OK
# Content-Type: text/html

# API endpoint (auth required)
curl https://app.preview.trakrf.id/api/v1/accounts
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (correct - auth required)
```

**Validation checklist:**
- ✅ `/healthz` returns 200 OK
- ✅ `/readyz` returns 200 OK (DB connected)
- ✅ `/health` returns JSON with version "0.1.0-preview"
- ✅ Frontend loads at `/` (200 OK)
- ✅ API requires authentication (401)

#### Step 6: Test PR Close Workflow

Verify that closing the PR re-syncs the preview branch:

```bash
# Close PR and delete branch
gh pr close test/preview-workflow --delete-branch
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. PR close triggers workflow
2. Workflow re-runs "Sync Preview Branch"
3. Preview branch updated (test PR removed, only remaining open PRs)
4. Railway re-deploys if preview branch changed

**Monitor workflow:**
- Go to: `https://github.com/trakrf/platform/actions`
- Verify workflow triggered by PR close event
- Check logs show preview branch reset to main (no open PRs)

#### Step 7: Test Multiple PR Scenario (Optional)

If you want to verify multiple PR merging:

```bash
# Create second test PR
git checkout -b test/preview-workflow-2
echo "# Second Test" > PREVIEW_TEST_2.md
git add PREVIEW_TEST_2.md
git commit -m "test: second preview test"
git push -u origin test/preview-workflow-2
gh pr create --title "Test: Second PR" --body "Testing multi-PR merge"
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. Workflow merges both PRs into preview branch (sorted by creation date)
2. Both PRs get deployment comments
3. Preview environment includes changes from both PRs
4. If one PR conflicts, it's reported in PR comments

#### Step 8: Test Merge Conflict Detection (Optional)

Create a PR that conflicts with main:

```bash
# Create conflicting change
git checkout -b test/conflict
echo "conflict" > .env.local.example
git add .env.local.example
git commit -m "test: create conflict"
git push -u origin test/conflict
gh pr create --title "Test: Conflict" --body "Testing conflict detection"
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. Workflow attempts to merge PR
2. Merge fails (conflict detected)
3. PR receives comment:
   ```
   ⚠️ Merge Conflict Detected

   This PR has conflicts with the current preview branch...
   ```
4. Preview branch continues with non-conflicting PRs

#### Validation Criteria (from spec)

All validation criteria from `spec.md` (lines 261-273):

- ✅ Preview branch auto-updates within 2 minutes of PR update
- ✅ Railway deploys preview branch within 5 minutes
- ✅ PR comments posted within 1 minute of preview sync
- ✅ Healthcheck at `https://app.preview.trakrf.id/healthz` returns 200 OK
- ✅ Merge conflicts detected and reported via PR comments
