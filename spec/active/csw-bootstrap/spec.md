# Feature: Bootstrap Claude Spec Workflow (CSW)

## Metadata
**Workspace**: monorepo
**Type**: feature

## Outcome
CSW system is configured and operational for the TrakRF monorepo with proper validation commands for Go backend and React frontend.

## User Story
As a developer
I want CSW ready to use
So that I can start using spec-driven development immediately

## Context
**Current**: CSW files added but not adapted to our stack
**Desired**: stack.md reflects Go + React monorepo, directories ready, system operational
**Examples**: Backend at `/backend`, frontend at `/frontend`

## Technical Requirements
- Update `spec/stack.md` with Go backend validation commands
- Update `spec/stack.md` with React frontend validation commands (pnpm)
- Ensure `spec/active/` directory exists
- Verify all validation commands work

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Backend validation commands run successfully
- [ ] Frontend validation commands run successfully
- [ ] `/check` command works
- [ ] Can create new specs using template

## Success Metrics
- [ ] `go test ./backend/...` passes
- [ ] `pnpm --prefix frontend run lint` passes
- [ ] `pnpm --prefix frontend run typecheck` passes
- [ ] `spec/active/` directory exists and is functional
